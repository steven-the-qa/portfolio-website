## Overview

Receipt Image Generator is a flexible, browser-based utility for creating realistic receipt images with customizable content, formatting, and visual characteristics. Whether you're developing OCR software, testing receipt scanning functionality, or need sample receipts for demos, this tool eliminates the need to create physical receipts for testing purposes.

## Features

- **Custom Receipt Creation**: Generate receipts with customizable store names, dates, items, prices, and totals
- **Realistic Formatting Options**: Configure receipt width, fonts, spacing, and overall appearance
- **Visual Effects**: Add realistic imperfections like skewing, rotation, shadows, and noise to simulate camera-captured receipts
- **Preset Templates**: Use built-in templates for common receipt styles (grocery, restaurant, retail, etc.)
- **Batch Generation**: Create multiple receipts with varying parameters for comprehensive testing
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface**: Create and preview receipts directly on mobile devices
- **No Server Dependencies**: Runs entirely in the browser with no backend requirements

## Benefits

- **Accelerated Development**: Quickly generate test images without needing physical receipts
- **Consistent Test Data**: Create controlled test cases with specific receipt characteristics
- **Edge Case Testing**: Simulate difficult-to-capture receipts with various imperfections
- **Environmentally Friendly**: Reduce paper waste by using digital mock receipts
- **Time and Cost Savings**: Eliminate manual receipt creation and photography
- **Improved Testing Coverage**: Test with a wider variety of receipt formats than would be practical to collect physically

## Use Cases

- Testing receipt scanning applications and OCR systems
- Developing expense tracking and management software
- Creating demonstration materials for financial applications
- QA testing for point-of-sale and inventory management systems
- Training machine learning models for receipt analysis
- Simulating receipt captures in various lighting and angle conditions

## Getting Started

1. Access the tool via your web browser (no installation required)
2. Choose a receipt template or start from scratch
3. Customize the receipt content, format, and appearance
4. Apply visual effects to simulate camera capture if desired
5. Preview the generated receipt

## Example Usage

- Generate receipts with specific totals to test expense limit functionality
- Create receipts with particular items to test categorization features
- Simulate poorly captured receipts to test the robustness of your OCR system
- Generate receipts in multiple languages to test international support

## Technical Details

This tool runs entirely in the browser using modern web technologies. No data is sent to any server during receipt generation, making it suitable for applications where data privacy is important.
