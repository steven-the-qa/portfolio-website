I created Social QA Bootcamp to help testers create unique career opportunities by combining QA skills with business strategy â€“ something rarely taught together in tech education.

Most tech courses focus solely on technical skills, completely ignoring content creation, marketing, social dynamics, and community building. Yet these social skills give you more leverage in your career than learning any single technology ever will.

This gap in the market inspired me to create a different kind of learning experience, one that intertwines technical and social skills to build truly future-proof QA careers.

<h2 id="section-1"><em>The Vision</em></h2>

### A Different Kind of Tech Education

After years of mentoring QA professionals through ADPList (2000+ minutes with mentees in 11 countries), I noticed most struggled with the same challenge: they knew how to test software but didn't know how to position themselves for better opportunities.

I wanted to create a course that taught both the technical and the social aspects of building a successful QA career.

Social QA Bootcamp was born from the realization that the combination of strong technical skills and the ability to showcase those skills in public offers an unbeatable advantage in today's market.

### Why "Social" QA?

The "social" in Social QA represents two essential components:

1. Building technical skills worth sharing
2. Learning how to share those skills effectively to create opportunities

This approach resonated with students who were tired of traditional tech education that left them with technical knowledge but no guidance on how to leverage it for career growth.

<h2 id="section-2"><em>Course Curriculum</em></h2>

Social QA Bootcamp offered a unique combination of technical training and social skills development:

### Technical Skills

- Setting up and configuring Playwright test automation projects
- Writing, debugging, and optimizing Playwright tests for web applications
- Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions for test automation
- Using AI tools (like Cursor) to accelerate development and testing
- Docker fundamentals for local test environment management
- Practical exploratory testing techniques

### Social & Career Skills

- Creating engaging LinkedIn content about technical projects
- Building in public to showcase skills and attract opportunities
- Meaningful community engagement strategies
- Using AI tools to enhance content creation
- Bug reporting skills that demonstrate QA expertise
- Personal branding for QA professionals

### Community Service Project

The capstone of the bootcamp is a community service project where students are asked to:

- Identified a need in the QA community
- Created a solution that provided real value
- Documented their process and learnings
- Shared their contribution publicly

This project is meant to cement the technical skills while demonstrating the power of building in public.

No student has gotten this far in the course yet, but I'll report back when the first student has.

Though Social QA Bootcamp is currently in-progress with its first and only planned cohort, the impact continues through the ongoing success of its students and the resources created during the program. I'm incredibly proud of what we accomplished together and the unique approach we pioneered in combining technical excellence with social strategy.

While I've since moved on to pursue new passions, the lessons learned from building and running Social QA will continue to influence how I approach education and community building in the future, and the 1st cohort continues to receive support from me as they make their way through the course.

When the first student completes the course, I'll have more to share. Stay tuned until then!
