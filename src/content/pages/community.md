When I started my first QA job in 2020, I knew nothing. It's only thanks to my teammates and managers that I learned to be the QA I am today.

In 2021, I had the chance to mentor other QA within the company as part of an internal training initiative. This was the "spark" for me.

As someone whose journey had been significantly helped by mentorship, I wanted to give back in an even bigger way, but I didn't know what that looked like. I just wanted to teach and mentor, not manage.

In January 2023, thanks to <a href="https://youtu.be/XgAMayF-JZY?si=Lzp0MRcSnt93srJn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Dan Koe video</a>, I found out there's a whole community of content creators using education as an online business model, helping people who are "one or two steps behind them." It was exactly what I was looking for, but I wasn't sure where to start. I sat on the idea for months.

In August 2023, I took the leap. I started experimenting with ways to <a href="/resources">productize</a> and share my QA knowledge. I've been involved in the community ever since.

### Non-Coding Tech Careers

Most people think about breaking into tech and immediately think they need to learn how to code. I got together with a few friends on Tech Twitter so we could lead a discussion about non-coding career options.

### Test Quest

Most of the DMs I get from QA professionals are about how to navigate the job market. So I made a newsletter.
