I also get my hands dirty testing new functionality.\n\nFrom February 2024 through February 2025, I spent time helping QA professionals navigate their careers & the job market. Check out my [Community](/community) and [Resources](/resources) pages for more details on that. Nowadays, I'm spending that time on pursuing an [ADAPT Level 2 parkour coaching certification](https://adaptqualifications.com/collections/coach-certifications-1?_=pf&pf_t_categories=Level%202%20Coach%20Certification).\n\nAfter work, my wife & I like to go on <a href='https://cosmicbobsleigh.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>fun weekend adventures</a> and explore the wonders of Door County: cherry-picking, meeting owls at the bird sanctuary, visiting lighthouses, and more. Our 2 black cats, Sadie & Bean, are the best of friends.\n\nWhen I need some alone time, I love to bike down to the skatepark to do some parkour or lounge on the couch playing video games. My violin probably wishes I played it more often."
