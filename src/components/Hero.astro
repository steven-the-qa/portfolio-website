Currently, I'm the QA Automation Engineer at Immunefi where I grow our Playwright test suite and coach the team on how to write great end-to-end tests. I also get my hands dirty testing new functionality.

From February 2024 through February 2025, I spent time helping QA professionals navigate their careers & the job market. Check out my [Community](/community), [Resources](/resources), and [Bootcamp](/bootcamp) pages for more details on that. Nowadays, I'm spending that time on pursuing an <a href="https://door-parkour.beehiiv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADAPT Level 2 parkour coaching certification</a>.

After work, my wife & I like to go on <a href='https://cosmicbobsleigh.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>fun weekend adventures</a> and explore the wonders of Door County: cherry-picking, meeting owls at the bird sanctuary, visiting lighthouses, and more. Our 2 black cats, Sadie & Bean, are the best of friends.

When I need some alone time, I love to bike down to the skatepark to do some parkour or lounge on the couch playing video games. My violin probably wishes I played it more often.`
